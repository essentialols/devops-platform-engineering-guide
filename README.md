# Upskilling from DevOps to Platform Engineering with MLOps

I found myself navigating the evolving landscape of DevOps, recognizing that the shift towards Platform Engineering, especially with the rise of MLOps, demands a refined skillset. My goal for this guide is to outline a practical path for DevOps engineers seeking to make this transition, grounded in real community insights and structured learning.

## Where You Are Now (Assessment)

Many of us in DevOps currently excel at managing infrastructure through code, automating deployments, and ensuring system reliability. We're comfortable with tools like Terraform for IaC, Ansible or Puppet for configuration management, and Kubernetes for container orchestration [1]. We set up CI/CD pipelines, monitor systems, and troubleshoot production issues. This foundational work is invaluable.

However, the nature of this work is changing. A significant portion, specifically "boilerplate, writing basic YAML, generating Terraform modules," is increasingly being automated by AI (user comment, 2 upvotes, not independently verified) [2]. This doesn't mean our roles are disappearing; rather, "AI isn't replacing DevOps yet, it's just raising the bar" (user comment, 2 upvotes, not independently verified) [2]. The new bar requires a deeper understanding of architecture, system trade-offs, and specialized domains like machine learning.

The core challenge for a DevOps engineer transitioning to Platform Engineering, particularly with an MLOps focus, is shifting from operating *applications* to building *platforms* that enable other engineers (including ML engineers) to operate their *own* applications efficiently and reliably. This means moving from a reactive, operational mindset to a proactive, product-oriented approach where the platform itself is the product [3].

To assess your current standing, consider these questions:

1.  **Depth of Kubernetes Knowledge:** Do you just deploy to Kubernetes, or do you understand its internal components (API server, scheduler, controllers, etcd) and how to extend it with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and operators?
2.  **Observability Practices:** Beyond basic monitoring, can you implement distributed tracing, structured logging, and advanced alert correlation across heterogeneous services?
3.  **Developer Experience (DX):** How much do you think about the friction developers face daily? Can you identify bottlenecks in their workflow beyond just CI/CD?
4.  **Cost vs. Reliability Trade-offs:** Can you articulate and implement decisions that balance infrastructure cost against service reliability and performance for different workloads, especially data-intensive ones? (user comment, 2 upvotes, not independently verified) [2]
5.  **Understanding Production Architecture:** Can you debug complex distributed systems and understand their holistic architecture, not just individual components? (user comment, 2 upvotes, not independently verified) [2]

Your answers to these questions will highlight areas for focus. The goal isn't just to add new tools, but to cultivate a design-centric mindset, proactively optimizing processes and improving the developer experience (user comment, 2 upvotes, not independently verified) [4].

## Phase 1: Foundations (Week 1-2)

This initial phase is about solidifying your understanding of Platform Engineering principles and beginning to see infrastructure through the lens of a product. You'll focus on concepts that elevate you from an infrastructure operator to a platform builder. One user reported the importance of "understanding of the entire vertical" (user comment, 2 upvotes, not independently verified) [4], emphasizing the need to grasp the full scope of business and technical requirements.

**Scenario:** Imagine you're tasked with reducing friction for developers deploying microservices. Instead of just giving them Kubernetes access, you need to provide a simplified, self-service experience.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Internal Developer Platform (IDP):** A collection of tools and services organized to provide a self-service experience for developers. An IDP acts as an abstraction layer over complex infrastructure, giving developers paved paths for common tasks [5].
*   **Platform as a Product:** Treating the platform itself as a product with its own users (developers), roadmap, and user experience considerations. This means understanding developer needs and building features that solve their problems.
*   **Control Plane vs. Data Plane:**
    *   **Control Plane:** The components that manage and orchestrate the system (e.g., Kubernetes API server, CI/CD pipelines). It doesn't handle user data directly.
    *   **Data Plane:** The components that process and serve user requests or data (e.g., application pods, databases).
*   **Abstraction Layers:** Simplifying complexity by hiding underlying details. A platform aims to provide appropriate abstractions to developers, reducing cognitive load. Some argue that "abstractions and such aren’t needed anymore since the cost to throw it away and re-do it is now low" due to AI (user comment, 2 upvotes, not independently verified) [4], but I view this as a potential oversimplification. Well-designed abstractions remain crucial for maintainability and collaboration.

**Core Tooling Focus:**

1.  **Kubernetes Deep Dive:** Go beyond deployment. Understand Kubernetes operators, CRDs, admission controllers, and extensibility. Learn how to build or customize a basic operator using the Operator SDK [6].
2.  **GitOps with Argo CD/Flux CD:** Understand how Git is the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application states.
3.  **Backstage.io:** Explore Backstage as an example of an open-source IDP framework. Understand its component catalog, software templates, and plugins.
4.  **Crossplane:** Learn how Crossplane extends Kubernetes to manage external cloud services (e.g., S3 buckets, RDS instances) as Kubernetes resources, unifying control plane for both infrastructure and applications [7].

**Example: Defining a Simple Backstage Component Catalog Entry**

Here's how a `catalog-info.yaml` file for a service might look in Backstage. This defines a component that the platform team manages:

```yaml
# catalog-info.yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: user-auth-service
  description: Handles user authentication and authorization
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: my-org/user-auth-service
    backstage.io/kubernetes-id: user-auth-service
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: team-alpha
  system: core-services
  consumesApis:
    - user-profile-api
  providesApis:
    - user-auth-api
  dependsOn:
    - resource:database-user-auth
```

This file declares the service's metadata, ownership, and dependencies, making it discoverable and manageable within the IDP. It simplifies how developers understand and interact with the service landscape.

**Trade-offs:**

*   **[Good] Increased Developer Velocity:** By abstracting complexity, developers can focus on business logic rather than infrastructure boilerplate.
*   **[Good] Standardized Deployments:** Enforces best practices and consistency across services, leading to more reliable systems.
*   **[Bad] Initial Investment:** Building and maintaining a platform requires significant upfront effort and ongoing commitment.
*   **[Bad] Abstraction Leakage:** Sometimes the underlying infrastructure details "leak" through, requiring developers to still understand some complexity.

### Practice Exercises for Phase 1:

1.  **Kubernetes Operator Development:** Create a simple Kubernetes operator (e.g., using `operator-sdk init --domain example.com --group app --version v1alpha1 --kind MyApp`) that watches for a custom resource and, for instance, deploys a Nginx pod whenever an instance of your custom resource is created.
2.  **Backstage Catalog Integration:** Set up a local instance of Backstage. Integrate an existing GitHub repository as a component in its software catalog. Explore creating a custom software template to provision new microservices.
3.  **GitOps Implementation:** Choose a simple application (e.g., a "Hello World" Nginx deployment) and set up a GitOps workflow using Argo CD. Ensure that changes pushed to Git automatically reflect in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Phase 2: Core Skills (Week 3-4)

Now we layer MLOps on top of the Platform Engineering foundation. This phase focuses on the unique infrastructure demands of machine learning workflows, from data ingestion to model serving. You'll move beyond generic application deployment to consider data pipelines, feature stores, and specialized hardware. This is where the "AI infrastructure" aspect truly shines, with a user noting that "a lot of AI infrastructure has to do with HPC and mostly around Nvidia stack. They are the market leaders. Go through things like RoCE, Infiniband, Nvidia Cumulus Linux, Bluefield DPU" (user comment, community consensus, not independently verified) [8].

**Scenario:** You need to enable ML engineers to train models, deploy them, and monitor their performance reliably, without them needing to be Kubernetes experts. This involves providing self-service tools for experiment tracking, data versioning, and model serving.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **MLOps Lifecycle:** Understanding the end-to-end process of developing, deploying, and managing machine learning models in production. This includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.
*   **Data Versioning & Lineage:** Tracking changes to datasets and understanding how data flows through different stages of a pipeline. This is crucial for reproducibility.
*   **Feature Stores:** Centralized repositories for sharing, discovering, and serving machine learning features consistently for both training and inference [9].
*   **Model Serving Patterns:** Different ways to deploy models for inference (e.g., REST API, batch inference, streaming inference). Includes A/B testing, canary deployments, and model rollbacks.
*   **Experiment Tracking:** Recording parameters, metrics, and artifacts for each model training run to facilitate comparison and reproducibility.
*   **HPC for ML:** High-Performance Computing specific to machine learning, often involving specialized hardware like GPUs (Nvidia A100/H100), high-speed interconnects (Infiniband, RoCE), and DPU technologies (Nvidia BlueField) for data processing and networking optimization.

**Core Tooling Focus:**

1.  **Kubeflow:** Explore Kubeflow Pipelines for orchestrating ML workflows on Kubernetes, Kubeflow Fairing for simplified model building, and Kubeflow Serving (KServe) for model deployment.
2.  **MLflow:** Understand MLflow for experiment tracking, model registry, and model serving. It offers a lightweight alternative or complement to Kubeflow for certain tasks [10].
3.  **Seldon Core/KServe:** Deep dive into these frameworks for production model serving, including capabilities for advanced deployment strategies (canary, A/B testing) and inference graph orchestration.
4.  **DVC (Data Version Control):** Learn DVC for versioning data and ML models alongside code, making ML projects reproducible [11].
5.  **NVIDIA Stack & HPC Concepts:** While you might not implement these directly from day one, understanding concepts like RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet), Infiniband, Nvidia Cumulus Linux (for network OS), and BlueField DPUs (for offloading infrastructure tasks) is critical for optimizing performance in large-scale ML training and inference (user comment, community consensus, not independently verified) [8].

**Example: A Simple Kubeflow Pipeline Component**

A Kubeflow pipeline is composed of components. Here's a conceptual Python component for a data preprocessing step:

```python
# preprocess_data_component.py
import kfp
from kfp import dsl
from kfp.v2.dsl import (
    component, 
    InputPath, 
    OutputPath, 
    Dataset, 
    Model, 
    Metrics
)

@component(base_image="python:3.9-slim", packages_to_install=["pandas", "scikit-learn"])
def preprocess_data(
    raw_dataset: InputPath[Dataset],
    processed_dataset: OutputPath[Dataset],
    scaler_model: OutputPath[Model]
):
    """
    Reads raw data, applies scaling, and saves processed data and scaler.
    """
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    import joblib

    df = pd.read_csv(raw_dataset)
    
    # Simple preprocessing example
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(df[['feature_a', 'feature_b']])
    df_processed = pd.DataFrame(scaled_features, columns=['feature_a', 'feature_b'])
    df_processed['target'] = df['target'] # Assuming 'target' is not scaled
    
    df_processed.to_csv(processed_dataset, index=False)
    joblib.dump(scaler, scaler_model)
    
    print(f"Processed data saved to {processed_dataset}")
    print(f"Scaler model saved to {scaler_model}")

# This component would then be used within a larger pipeline definition.
```

This snippet illustrates how data (`Dataset`) and models (`Model`) are treated as first-class citizens in a component, with explicit input/output paths. This clarity is essential for building robust ML pipelines.

**Trade-offs:**

*   **[Good] Reproducibility:** Explicitly tracking data, code, and environment enables consistent model retraining and debugging.
*   **[Good] Scalability:** Leveraging Kubernetes allows ML workloads to scale dynamically, from small experiments to large-scale distributed training.
*   **[Bad] Complexity:** MLOps platforms introduce significant overhead and a steep learning curve due to the specialized nature of ML workflows.
*   **[Bad] Resource Intensity:** ML training, especially with deep learning, can be extremely resource-intensive, demanding careful management of GPUs and high-speed storage.

### Practice Exercises for Phase 2:

1.  **Kubeflow Pipeline Deployment:** Deploy Kubeflow on a Kubernetes cluster. Create a simple Kubeflow Pipeline that preprocesses a dummy dataset, trains a basic scikit-learn model, and exports the model.
2.  **MLflow Experiment Tracking:** Set up an MLflow server. Instrument a Python script to train a simple model, log its parameters, metrics, and the model artifact to MLflow. Review your experiments in the MLflow UI.
3.  **Model Serving with KServe:** Deploy KServe on your cluster. Take the model artifact from your MLflow experiment, package it (e.g., using a custom Docker image or a pre-built KServe runtime), and deploy it as an inference service. Test the endpoint.
4.  **Data Versioning with DVC:** Initialize DVC in a new project. Version a small dataset (`data.csv`) and a trained model (`model.pkl`). Push these versions to a remote storage (e.g., S3 or MinIO).

## Phase 3: Applied Projects (Week 5-8)

This phase is about integrating your newfound knowledge into tangible projects. You'll apply Platform Engineering principles to build self-service capabilities for ML engineers, focusing on end-to-end workflows. This is where you bring together IDP concepts with MLOps tools. It also involves adopting pragmatic approaches like leveraging AI for documentation, as "AI is also very good at documenting everything... that problem was eliminated by AI even quicker than boilerplate" (user comment, 10 upvotes, not independently verified) [12].

**Scenario:** Your organization needs a unified platform where ML engineers can initiate new ML projects, manage their datasets, train models, and deploy them to production with minimal operational overhead.

**Project Idea 1: Self-Service ML Project Scaffolding with Backstage**

*   **Goal:** Create a Backstage template that allows an ML engineer to spin up a new ML project repository with pre-configured boilerplate, CI/CD for ML (e.g., using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI triggering Kubeflow/MLflow), and basic infrastructure definitions (e.g., a dedicated Kubernetes namespace, S3 bucket for data).
*   **Components:** Backstage (Software Templates), GitHub/GitLab, Kubernetes (namespaces, service accounts), S3/MinIO (for data storage), basic Kubeflow/MLflow configuration files.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  Define a Backstage template YAML that specifies input parameters (e.g., project name, ML engineer name, target cloud).
    2.  Write a templated `cookiecutter` (or similar) structure that generates the new repository. This includes:
        *   `Dockerfile` for the ML model.
        *   Basic Python project structure (`src/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/`).
        *   `dvc.yaml` for data versioning.
        *   CI/CD pipelines (e.g., `.github/workflows/ml_ci.yaml`) that include steps for linting, testing, and triggering ML training/deployment pipelines.
        *   Terraform/Pulumi code for provisioning cloud resources (S3, Kubernetes namespace).
    3.  Integrate the template into your Backstage instance.
    4.  Demonstrate the end-to-end flow: ML engineer clicks a button in Backstage, fills a form, and gets a new, ready-to-use ML project repository and associated infrastructure.

**Project Idea 2: Automated Model Deployment Pipeline with GitOps and KServe**

*   **Goal:** Build a GitOps-driven pipeline that automatically deploys new versions of an ML model to production using KServe whenever a new model artifact is pushed to the MLflow Model Registry or a similar artifact store.
*   **Components:** Git (for model deployment manifests), MLflow Model Registry, Argo CD/Flux CD, KServe, Kubernetes.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  Set up an MLflow Model Registry.
    2.  Create a dedicated Git repository (e.g., `model-deployments`) for KServe `InferenceService` manifests.
    3.  Configure Argo CD to monitor this `model-deployments` repository and synchronize its contents to your Kubernetes cluster.
    4.  Create an automation script (e.g., a webhook receiver or a CI/CD job) that triggers whenever a new model version is registered in MLflow.
    5.  This script should:
        *   Fetch the new model artifact's URI from MLflow.
        *   Generate or update a KServe `InferenceService` YAML manifest in the `model-deployments` Git repository, pointing to the new model version.
        *   Commit and push this change to Git.
    6.  Argo CD will detect the change and deploy the new model version via KServe. Leverage KServe's traffic splitting capabilities for canary deployments.

**Example: KServe InferenceService Manifest for a New Model Version**

```yaml
# kserve-model-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: "serving.kserve.io/v1beta1"
kind: "InferenceService"
metadata:
  name: "my-ml-model"
  namespace: "ml-production"
spec:
  predictor:
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 5
    model:
      modelFormat:
        name: sklearn
        version: "1.0"
      storageUri: "s3://mlflow-artifacts/1/{{MLFLOW_RUN_ID}}/artifacts/model" # Placeholder, actual URI from MLflow
      # Optional: Add traffic splitting for canary deployment
      # traffic: 10 # Send 10% traffic to this new revision
```

This manifest, when updated and pushed to a GitOps repository, would trigger Argo CD to deploy or update the `my-ml-model` inference service on Kubernetes. The `storageUri` would dynamically point to the latest model artifact registered in MLflow.

**Community Insights on AI & Documentation:**
As one user noted, "AI is also very good at documenting everything, I have comments on every little decision made, every problem solved, every bug fixed, and complete docs for every script, module and workflow, including diagrams" (user comment, 10 upvotes, not independently verified) [12]. Incorporate this into your project workflow. Use tools like GitHub Copilot or other AI assistants to generate initial drafts for READMEs, inline code comments, and architecture diagrams. While AI can't replace critical thinking, it significantly reduces the burden of boilerplate documentation.

### Practice Exercises for Phase 3:

1.  **End-to-End ML Pipeline with DVC and Kubeflow:** Build a complete ML workflow on Kubeflow that includes data versioning with DVC, training a model, tracking experiments with MLflow (or Kubeflow's built-in experiment tracker), and deploying the model using KServe, all orchestrated via Kubeflow Pipelines.
2.  **Platform Reliability Testing:** Design and implement chaos engineering experiments (e.g., using LitmusChaos) for your ML inference services. Test how your platform responds to node failures, network latency, or service restarts, ensuring model availability.
3.  **Cost Optimization for ML Workloads:** Analyze the resource utilization of your ML training and inference workloads. Implement strategies for cost optimization, such as right-sizing Kubernetes pods, using spot instances for training, or leveraging GPU sharing solutions. Document your cost-saving decisions and their impact.
